# Simplistic
## This is my simple Checklist app. I understand that I could have used the MVVM architecture to clean up the code. If I had used MVVM architecture, I would've stored each checklist's data inside the database, communicated between the database and a Checklist Data Accessable Object interface to then use LiveData as a way to bring that data to my UI and attach it to my custom view and layouts, but instead I opted to use JSON since it's something I have little to no experience using.

## This app demonstrates my knowledge of the following Java and Android System APIs:
- *RecyclerViews*
- *Swipe and Drag functionality*
- *Custom Views*
- *JSON File writing and parsing*
- *Search/Filter functionality*
- *Parcelable interfacing*
- *Intent usage*
- *ConstraintLayout*
- *LinearLayout*
- *FAB*
